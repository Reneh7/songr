## Lab13

In this lab beside the album creation we added song addition. Users can view a list of available songs and albums,
explore detailed album information, and even add new songs to existing albums. Thymeleaf templates are used for rendering dynamic HTML pages,
creating a seamless user interface. The project employs a Postgres SQL database for data storage and retrieval, enabling efficient organization and
retrieval of music catalog information.
